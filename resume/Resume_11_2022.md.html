Experience
===================================================

2021-Present
: *Engine Technical Lead, Ready At Dawn Studios*
: <br><br>• Worked closely with engineers from Qualcomm and Oculus to map out efficient rendering strategies for the Oculus Quest 2. Wrote a series of low-level performance benchmarks to extract performance characteristics of the Quest 2 GPU and Vulkan driver.
: <br><br>• Architected a proposal to implement virtual texturing and GPU-driven rendering to improve batching and performance on the Quest 2. Wrote a prototype virtual texture system that made use of sparse (tiled) resources, sampler feedback, and runtime page generation + block compression.
: <br><br>• Provided daily technical guidance and mentoring to the other 8 members of the engine team
: <br><br>• Worked with the tools lead to direct efforts to bring up a new standalone world editor alongside improved world-creation workflows for future titles. Re-worked lighting and shadowing systems to make them compatible with the new editor.
: <br><br>• Designed a new low-level "stateless" draw and compute interface for the engine that's built around universal support for bindless resources.

2015-2021
: *Lead Engine Programmer, Ready At Dawn Studios*
: <br><br>• Served as the sole lead and manager for the engine team consisting of 6-7 programmers. Provided guidance, direction, and mentoring to members of the team. Planned high-level roadmaps and worked with reports to generate tasks.
: <br><br>• Wrote the initial prototype of the data-driven ECS that was adopted into the engine. Worked with gameplay engineers to flesh out the interfaces and ensure it had required functionality for their use cases.
: <br><br>• Implemented VR rendering optimizations including instanced stereo rendering and a software solution for variable-rate shading. Adapted existing rendering features to make them work correctly in PC VR.
: <br><br>• Wrote a new runtime occlusion culling system based on CPU rasterization of low-poly proxy occluder meshes. Implemented the full authoring and processing pipeline for artists and designers.
: <br><br>• Implemented a generic projected decal system using bindless textures to allow for arbitrary texture sampling within the forward rendering pixel shader. Wrote a fallback system using a runtime atlas for D3D11.
: <br><br>• Worked with another programmer to implement the D3D12 backend for the engine. Wrote a system for pre-creating PSOs at load time using a state registration interface. Later implemented full bindless support for shader inputs with a PS4 compatibility layer.
: <br><br>• Re-wrote the core material and shader system to provide a more extensible interface and reduce the number of required shader permutations. Wrote a flexible system to allow choosing whether or not to permute on material parameters without requiring source code changes.
: <br><br>• Optimized CPU performance for frustum culling and mesh LOD selection using ISPC. Worked with a gameplay programmer to globally improve component system update scheduling across the entire engine.

: <br><br>* Implemented Forward+ rendering with support for multiple depth bins, FFT-based artist-driven lens flare effects, hair shading, eye shading with refraction and caustics, pre-filtered roughness maps, deferred decal system, and dynamic AO based on proxy occluder capsules.
: <br><br>• Implemented a custom Temporal AA solution that utilized MSAA and higher-order filtering to achieve high temporal stability with no flickering.
: <br><br>• Researched and implemented an improved shadow mapping system that utilized Exponential Variance Shadow Maps and Sample Distribution Shadow Maps to improve usability, filtering quality, and perceived shadow map resolution
: <br><br>• Collaborated with teammates to research and implement spherical gaussians as an alternative encoding for lightmaps. Added support for using spherical gaussian radiance with cloth, hair, and skin shading models
: <br><br>• Re-wrote the shader compilation pipeline to allow for lazy generation of required shader permutations in the offline content build pipeline once the full mesh + material combination was known.
: <br><br>• Worked with artists and designers to heavily optimize content for The Order: 1886 to ensure it shipped at a stable 30 fps on PS4. Optimized streaming, decompression, memory allocators, and gameplay system memory usage across the entire game.

2009-2012
: *Engine Programmer, Ready At Dawn Studios*
: <br><br>• Collaborated with a small team to make a playable vertical slice demo that was ultimately used to get The Order: 1886 green-lit, serving as one of two graphics programmers
