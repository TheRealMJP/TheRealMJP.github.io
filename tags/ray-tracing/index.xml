      <description>Ray Tracing Gems II was released a few weeks ago, and like the first one it&#39;s free to download as a PDF from the publisher&#39;s website. There are 50 articles in this thing written by over 80 authors, so I think it&#39;s safe to say that this book is absolutely jam-packed with useful knowledge and techniques related to ray tracing.
Yours truly contributed a chapter called &amp;quot;Using Bindless Resources With DirectX Raytracing&amp;quot;, which as you&#39;d expect is all about using bindless techniques in the context of DXR.</description>
